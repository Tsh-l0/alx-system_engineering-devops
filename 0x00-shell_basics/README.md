In this assignment we learned basic shell commands. These are commands that can be used in order to navigate the shell, look around the shell, manipulating files in the shell. We also learned how to make files executable using #!/bin/bash as well as the chmod +x command. 

Some commands learned here are:
mv 
cp 
ls 
mkdir 
rmdir
etc.
